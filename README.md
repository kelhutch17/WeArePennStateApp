# WeArePennStateApp
Intro to iOS Workshop - Demo App

We Are, Penn State!

Requirements:
- Build an app in Swift that allows you to perform the We Are Penn State cheer!
- Use a UILabel to display the String to show the part of the cheer we are on (“We Are”, “Penn State”, “Thank you”, “You’re Welcome”)
- Use a UIButton that will change the label string when pressed
- Use a counter to track which part of the cheer you are on


Bonus:
- Start with the label hidden so that on first button press we show the label
- Add a UIImageView to show fun cheer images upon button press
- Add a Timer object that will reset you back to the start of the cheer after 3 seconds of waiting when the cheer finishes.
- Disable the button when the timer is running so that if the user presses it while the timer is running, nothing happens
- Use a switch statement to check which cheer count you are on to determine what string/image to show
- Make the app your own! Add color, extra UI elements, and any other features you can think of.
